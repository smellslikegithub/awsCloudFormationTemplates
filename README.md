# awsCloudFormationTemplates

This repository contains my own templates for performing actions/launch operation in the AWS platform. Each module (Folder) consists of YAML files, explaining what they do in regards to launching.

The collection of YAML files serves as a template to quickly go through the way resource, types, properties and other aspects work. Feel free to add more templates but make sure that they work and launch in the AWS console first.
