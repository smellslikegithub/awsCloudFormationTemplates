<h2><i>Aws Cloud Formation Templates</i></h2>

This repository contains my own templates for performing actions/launch operation in the AWS platform. Each module (Folder) consists of YAML files, explaining what they do in regards to launching.

The collection of YAML files serves as a template to quickly go through the way resource, types, properties and other aspects work. Feel free to add more templates but make sure that they work and launch in the AWS console first.

Each Folder has a note.txt file in it explaining the basics of the concept. Each Folder has been named to represent the concept that I will write and code about.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS Console (For launching and verifying templates)</li>
      <li>VS-CODE for writing the template</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>VS-CODE plugins used</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>YAML Language Support VSCODE plugin</li>
      <li>CloudFormation YAML snippets fo VS Code</li>
      <li>AWS ToolKit</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
I will later, add images of diagrams that represent the yaml code to give a better overall picture of what teh code is trying to make.
