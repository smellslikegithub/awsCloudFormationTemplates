* Mappings matches a KEY to a corresponding set of named values.
* For example, if someone wants to set values based on a region
we can creat mappings by specifying KEYS as region names and values specifying something. 

* Those Key and values can then be used by the intrinsic function "Fn::FindInMap"

For example.

Mappings:
  Mapping01: # This is the resournce identifier/named
    Key01: #Top Level keys # KEY NAME can be anything
      Name: Val1 # Within Level Keys
    Key01:
      Name: Val2

* The above template can be represented as a real example.

Mappings:
  RegionMapList:
    us-east-1:
      "HVM64": "ami-016b213e65284e9c9" # Key name could have been "AMI-ID" as well.
    us-east-2:
      "HVM64": "ami-someVersionNumber"
