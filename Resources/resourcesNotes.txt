# Resources are key components of a STACK

# Resources is a REQUIRED SECTION and needs to be defined for the STACK to work properly in the cloud formation.

# The general resource pattern/template looks like this :

Resources:
    # This can be a logical name like "MyEC2Instace" or "EC2" etc
    Logical ID:
        Type: Resource Type 
        Properties: # Set of properties for the Resource

# Resources can reference other resources using "Intrinsic Function Ref". One example could be adding a "Security Group to the EC2 instance"
